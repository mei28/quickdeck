# QuickDeck

QuickDeck is a simple command-line utility to quickly open SlideShare presentations in your default web browser. It extracts the embed URL from a SlideShare presentation URL and opens it directly, making it a handy tool for faster access to SlideShare content.

## Installation

You can install QuickDeck by cloning the repository and building it with Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.

```
cargo install quickdeck
```


## Usage
To use QuickDeck, simply pass the SlideShare presentation URL as an argument:


```bash
quickdeck https://www.slideshare.net/example/presentation
```

If successful, the SlideShare presentation will open in your default web browser.
